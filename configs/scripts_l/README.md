Most if not all of these scripts are `bash` scripts and only works on `Linux`

- **walld** - Make sure that `swww` is installed, `sudo pacman -S swww`
- **random-wall** - `swww` is also required for this to work, all wallpapers need to be store in `~/Pictures/Wallapers` if the folder do not exist, create them
