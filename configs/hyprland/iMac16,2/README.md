# iMac on Arch running Hyprland
Most stuff work, however I had to install Manjaro, because I gave up on getting the wifi card to work. Manjaro installed all needed drivers.

# Hyprland
- Wifi keeps asking me to connect to wifi everytime the system reboots/restarts
- Speakers works but in 2.1 channel, they sounds a bit weird
